console.log(P1.__proto__);
console.log(P1.__proto__.__proto__);

const arr = [8,9,1,1,3,6,9,3,8]

 console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype);  //true

 console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__); //bcz of prototype chain it will point to the contructor unction of object

    //so in this case when you create an object of class and pass the parameter to it .. it will go to constructor function and in that it will call setter for setting the full name (if it ssatisfy the critaria) and in birthYear it will consider normal birthYear value.

POINTS TO REMEMBER FOR USING CLASS-

1. classes are not hoisted (you cannot use them without creating them first)
2. classes are first- class citizes (u can pass them into a function and also return  them from the function (bcz classes are just special type of function behind the scene))
3. class body can only be excuted in strict mode .

*/



/* ------------------------ GETTERS AND SETTERS IN JS -------------------------- */

/*
how to use getter and setter on a class is  shown above.
and getter and setter can be very useful for data validation.

1. you can use getter and setter on any regular object as well as on class  in js
2. the getter and setter act as a property when you want to access them 
3. we use get or set keyword before the method accheive getter setter
4. it not necessary to have both getter and setter .

*/

/*

//eg using object

const account = {
    ownerName : 'sonu',
    movment : [23,90,18,90,23],

    get latest(){
        return this.movment.slice(-1).pop();
    },

    // we can add or set the property using this .. and any setter method needs to have only one parameter
    //note in this we have used the comma
    set latest(mov){
        this.movment.push(mov)
    }
}

//to access getter
console.log(account.latest); //note here we are not calling it as a method bcz its just a property

//to access setter and set a property on it.
account.latest = 7 ; //this is how we set the property in it.
console.log(account.movment);

*/

/* ----------------- Object.create() method in js ------------------------ */


/*
1.
all the methods that we want all the person object to inherits we put it into a perticular object (prototype).. and then we create the new object using Obect.create(pass the prototype object here)

when we use  the new operator in constructor function or classes it automatically set the prototype of instances to the constructors prototype property.

in case of object.create()  we manually set the prototype of newly created object (in below case sonu) to the Person object..... 

but now a days using object.create is least prefer way

//here we are setting explicitly that person.proto is actulally the prototype of sonu

    init(fname,birthYear){
        this.fname = fname;
        this.birthYear = birthYear
    }
}


const sonu = Object.create(PersonProto);

// we can also check this
console.log(sonu.__proto__ === PersonProto);


const rink = Object.create(PersonProto);
rink.init('rink',1999)
rink.calcAge2();

//here we created 2 objects sonu and rinkal (using  Object.create) and  whatever methods this two object want to access (or same goes for property as well but for that we need to create method in there like init or set values maully like we did on sonu object) we put into a object and pass that object to object.create method


// this note is for general -- we can also put methods in object(all object that we create ) same as put above

// IMPORTANT-
//object.create() methods creates the new object and prototype of this object is the object that we pass in .. so above case sonu is new object created from Object.create() and prototype of this object is set to PersonProto bcz that is the object we passed in.
