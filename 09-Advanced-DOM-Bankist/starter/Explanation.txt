in the handle hover function we are first checking if the target (link which is pressed) contains the nav_link classs and if contains then we are getting that target link ..
then for implimenting the event deligation  we have selected closest parent element i.e nav and under that we have selcted all nav links and checked if the nav link is same as target link if yes we set opacity value 1 for that and for others we have set 0.5 opacity .
we have bound the bind method to handelover and the value we have passed in bind method is set as this value in handelover ...bind value is always refers as this ..
